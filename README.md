# Janggi

Janggi, sometimes called Korean chess, is a strategy board game popular in Korea. The game was derived from xiangqi (Chinese chess) of China and is very similar to it, including the starting position of the pieces, and the 9Ã—10 gameboard, but without the xiangqi "river" dividing the board horizontally in the middle.

Janggi is played on a board nine lines wide by ten lines long. The game is sometimes fast paced due to the jumping cannons and the long-range elephants, but professional games most often last over 150 moves and so are typically slower than those of Western chess.
